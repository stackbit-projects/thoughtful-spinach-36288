Everty is a startup based in the EV Charge Management sector, in April 2021 our team at Test-Ed did software testing for their mobile app, web app, and Dashboard. Here is the work we did for them:

# The Test Process

###### How we tested the app.

## User Journey

The first part was to simulate a **User Journey**. We mapped out from beginning to end how a user is supposed to use the app, and we executed the step-by-step process, taking notes on our impressions, and identifying the pain points and drop-off points in the user experience.

We chose to do a User Journey to address the needs of Everty, who told us that their main concern was the quality of the front end of their app. By doing the User Journey, we were able to get relevant information on how well the app works.

By doing the User Journey we learned that the app had various issues relating to security, performance, and usability, and we were able to report these to Everty team for action.

## Field Research

To complete our User Journey, we felt it was necessary to visit a real world charge station, it's hardware that we didn't have access to at our homes or inside Fishburners, and it was really important to the experience of the user.

We needed to understand two things:

*   What the station looks like, if it has instructions on it and what those are like.

*   How smooth the process of using the app to choose a station and find it actually is.

By doing Field Research, we were no longer just testers role playing in an office tapping away, we were actually seeing the product as the user sees it. We had to rely on the app to find a station, and we got to see what the station looks like for ourselves. We learned that the instructions on the station were a pain point in the User Journey. We also learned that the app had usability issues that led to us using PlugShare (a third-party EV app) to find the station instead.

## Opposition Research

Everty told us that they weren't just concerned about their front end, but how they compared to other apps in the EV Charge Market. They described them as having "*slicker*" and "*smoother*" interfaces, and wanted to learn where they could improve. We decided to see "*slick and smooth*" for ourselves.

We downloaded the apps by two of their competitors, ChargeFox and ChargePoint, and found that they have really good features that not only was Everty lacking, but also that we would not have thought to mention otherwise! We also downloaded a third-party app called PlugShare to see how well it worked with both Everty and the two other companies' apps.

# The Report

###### How we collected and delivered our findings.

## Presentation

We wrapped up the project with a verbal presentation for the Everty CEO and Development Lead, along with a slide show. We spoke for 10 minutes about what we learned. We reiterated the main points to show that we understood what Everty asked of us, how we shaped our test around their needs and our rationale. Then we gave Everty four major takeaways in a digestible and memorable format to communicate what we learned, explaining each in detail with visual examples and citing research to justify our conclusions.

## Bug Report

We curated a conventional bug report in a spreadsheet, identifying the bugs and pain points the app had in both the format of a spreadsheet, but also in a Kanban Board with pictures and links.

## Feature Comparison

We made a second spreadsheet, this time for the purpose of giving an easily readable Feature Comparison chart. This allowed us to get across where Everty was lacking and excelling in areas that weren't necessarily bugs, comparing them to PlugShare and the two aforementioned competitors.

## Mind Map

We made a visual flowchart/mind map version of the Feature Comparison so that the client could see how Everty and the other apps we researched actually implemented their respective features, and learn from their graphic design to improve the usability of their app.
